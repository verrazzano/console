# Verrazzano Console

The Verrazzano Console is the User Interface for accessing and managing Verrazzano components and applications deployed in a Verrazzano environment.

## Repository structure

The Verrazzano Console main source repository includes the following components:

- [Oracle JET hooks](scripts/hooks) contains [hooks](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/jet/6/develop/getting-started-oracle-jet-web-application-development.html#GUID-0127CD04-FA1A-48FB-970A-FEEA8B28C6E7) used for building and running Console application.
- [Custom Components](src/ts/jet-composites) contains the [Oracle JET Custom Components](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/F18039_01/reference-typescript/CompositeOverview.html) which are basic building blocks for the Console.
- [views](src/ts/views) and [viewModels](src/ts/viewModels) contain the Oracle JET view and viewModels used in the Console. See [Oracle JET Architecture](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/jet410/jet/developer/GUID-293CB342-196F-4FC3-AE69-D1226A025FBB.htm#JETDG113) for more details.
- [test](test) contains the tests and related configuration for Console.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 14.x+ (with NPM)

  You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install nodejs

  ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
    nvm install 14.7
  ```

- [Oracle JET CLI](https://github.com/oracle/ojet-cli) 9.1.x+

  Console is developed using [Oracle JET](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html) framework and Oracle JET CLI is required to execute Oracle JET tooling commands.
  `npm` can be used to install the CLI. Read more about the installation options [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/developer-tools/jet/tutorials/jetin/index.html).

  ```bash
    npm install -g @oracle/ojet-cli
  ```

- Access to Verrazzano API and Keycloak server url

  The Verrazzano Console requires url of the Keycloak server (for authentication) and the API url of the Verrazzano environment (for fetching environment and applications' data). The api url generally will be `https://api.v8o-env.v8o-domain.com` and Keycloak server url will be `https://Keycloak.v8o-env.v8o-domain.com` where `v8o-env` will be the name of the Verrazzano environment, in case of OCI DNS or `default` in case of `xip.io` DNS and `v8o-domain.com` will be the DNS Zone domain. For installing and accessing Verrazzano - see the [installation instructions](https://github.com/verrazzano/verrazzano/blob/master/install/README.md).

### Setup

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/verrazzano/console.git
  cd console
  nvm use 14.7
  npm install
```

### Run development server

#### Setup Keycloak client:

To run the development server, we first need to setup the `webui` client in Keycloak to authenticate login and api requests from the localhost. This is the default client used by the Console that is deployed in Verrazzano environment and same client can be used for the development server running on localhost. However you may also setup your own separate client for local access. Read more about Keycloak clients [here](https://www.Keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#oidc-clients).

- Access the Keycloak Administration console for your Verrazzano environment - `https://keycloak.v8o-env.v8o-domain.com`
- Login with Keycloak admin user and password. Generally the Keycloak admin user name is `keycloakadmin` and password can be obtained from your management cluster using
  ```bash
    kubectl get secret --namespace keycloak keycloak-http -o jsonpath={.data.password} | base64 --decode; echo
  ```
  See [Get console credentials](https://github.com/verrazzano/verrazzano/blob/master/install/README.md#6-get-console-credentials) for more information on accessing Keycloak and other user interfaces in a Verrazzano environment.
- Navigate to "Clients" and click the client named "webui". On the Settings screen - go to "Valid Redirect URIs" and click + to add the redirect url `http://localhost:8000/*`.
- One the same page - go to "Web Origins" and click + to add `http://localhost:8000`.
- Click Save.

#### Get Verrazzano user credentials:

The Verrazzano Console accesses the Verrazzano API using [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) based authentication provided by [Keycloak Authorization Services](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/4.8/authorization_services/). To access this token from Keycloak, the user accessing the Console must be logged into Verrazzano Keycloak. Verrazzano installations have a default user `verrazzano` configured in Verrazzano Keycloak which can be used to login. To access the password for `verrazzano` user from management cluster - use

```bash
   kubectl get secret --namespace verrazzano-system verrazzano -o jsonpath={.data.password} | base64 --decode; echo
```

#### Setup environment variables:

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
  export VZ_AUTH=true
  export VZ_KEYCLOAK_URL=<your Keycloak url> e.g. https://keycloak.default.11.22.33.44.xip.io
  export VZ_UI_URL=http://localhost:8000
  export VZ_CLIENT_ID=<your client id which allows redirect uri on localhost:8000 or webui if using default>
```

##### Start server:

```bash
  ojet serve
```

This should start a browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). On first access, and on expiry of the [refresh token](https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/), you will be required to login to Keycloak with `verrazzano` user and password obtained in [Get Verrazzano user credentials](#get-verrazzano-user-credentials)

## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit tests for Verrazzano Console are written using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and require the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to be installed. To Run Tests for the Console, execute:

```bash
  make unit-test
```

## Building

To build the Console:

- Oracle JET build:

  ```
  make ojet-build
  ```

- Docker build:
  ```
  make build
  ```

## Pull request process

- Fork the repository.
- Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using the issue number as part of your branch name, for example, `1234-fixes`.
- Ensure that any documentation is updated with the changes that are required by your fix.
- Ensure that any samples are updated if the base image has been changed.
- Submit the pull request. Do not leave the pull request blank. Explain exactly what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate your changes. Ensure that you reference the issue you created as well. We will assign the pull request to 2-3 people for review before it is merged.

## Introducing a new dependency

Please be aware that pull requests that seek to introduce a new dependency will be subject to additional review. In general, contributors should avoid dependencies with incompatible licenses, and should try to use recent versions of dependencies. Standard security vulnerability checklists will be consulted before accepting a new dependency. Dependencies on closed-source code, including Oracle's, will most likely be rejected.

Dependencies that satisfy all those constraints, can be added by:

- Installing the dependency using `npm i <dep@version> --save`
- Editing the [src/js/path_mapping.json](src/js/path_mapping.json) file to tell JET to bundle the library with the application. Instructions for Oracle JET 9 are here: https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/developer-tools/jet/9/develop/add-third-party-tools-or-libraries-your-oracle-jet-application.html
